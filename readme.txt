Enhance your GB experience with Block Shortcuts for GenerateBlocks, featuring a Pattern Importer, v1 to v2 transforms, container shortcuts, and more.

== Description ==

MediaRon Block Shortcuts for GenerateBlocks is an add-on for <a href="https://generatepress.com/">GenerateBlocks</a> that brings additional functionality and enhancements to your block editing experience. Key features include:

1. **Pattern Importer**: Easily import remote patterns, including all images and unique IDs, ensuring no style conflicts.
2. **Version 1 to Version 2 Blocks Converter**: Stuck on an old v1 site? Convert v1 to v2 blocks with a quick transform, or surgically behind a useful contextual menu shortcut.
3. **Adobe Font Support**: Integrate Adobe Fonts from popular font plugins like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-typekit-fonts/">Astra’s Typekit plugin</a> and <a href="https://creativethemes.com/blocksy/docs/extensions/adobe-typekit-fonts/">Blocksy’s Adobe Font module</a>.
4. **Container Block Wrapping and Unwrapping**: Select multiple blocks and wrap them in a Container block with ease. Just as easily, you can unwrap the container via a contextual shortcut.
5. **Transform the Group block to a Container**: Convert Group blocks into Container blocks, maintaining all internal blocks.
6. **Command Palette Shortcuts**: Access GenerateBlocks settings quickly with shortcut commands in the block editor’s Command Palette. This includes a post-wide v1 to v2 block conversion shortcut. Other commands allow for quick regeneration of GenerateBlocks styles, and a command for outlining different blocks such as grids and containers.
7. **Unique ID Generation**: Avoid style conflicts by generating new unique IDs for duplicated or copied blocks. This is still very useful today.
8. **Build Styles for Select Post Types and Templates**: Have GenerateBlocks regenerate site-wide styles based on your selected post types or FSE templates.
9. **Useful Block Commands**: Convert all paragraph blocks into Text blocks (with paragraphs being selected) as well as converting all headlines into a Text block with appropriate headings selected.
10. **Add a Global Menu Toolbar Shortcut**: The current admin bar only shows overlays. With Block Shortcuts, you can see all available menu items from a top-level admin menu in the toolbar in both the admin and the frontend.

MediaRon Block Shortcuts for GenerateBlocks is perfect for users looking to streamline their GenerateBlocks workflow and add more versatility to the block editor design experience.

= How does this plugin help with v1 block migration? =

With two very useful shortcuts.

1. A contextual menu (best used in the List View) allows you to convert the selected blocks from v1 to v2+.
2. A command (using CMD+K) that'll convert all v1 blocks into v2 at once.

The plugin also allows you to load v1 blocks alongside v2 blocks, with labels clearly separating the two so you can tell which block version you're dealing with.

= What is the Pattern Importer Block and how does it work? =
The Pattern Importer allows you to import GenerateBlocks patterns, automatically generating unique IDs and importing remote images inline, which is perfect for copying patterns from live to local in seconds.

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes, free as in beer. It was called "GB Extras" when it was a pro plugin, but the parent company had to close its doors. Rather than let a useful tool languish on GitHub unnoticed, I've decided to release it for free on .org to be open-source and freely available as long as possible.
